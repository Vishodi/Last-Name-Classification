# Name Validation AI

[![Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support-Me-brightgreen)](https://www.example.com/donate?crypto=YOUR_CRYPTO_ID)

Name Validation AI is an intelligent system that classifies first names as **real** or **fake**. This project demonstrates two primary approaches:

- **Reinforcement Learning Approach:** A custom Gym environment coupled with a PPO agent.
- **Transformer-based Approach:** Fine-tuning a transformer model (using Hugging Face Transformers) for binary classification with the final model saved in the `.safetensors` format.

Both models are equipped with detailed testing (including confusion matrix visualization) and API deployment capabilities.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to determine if a given first name is "real" (from a curated dataset) or "fake" (randomly generated). The project includes:

- **Custom Reinforcement Learning Setup:** Using OpenAI Gym and PPO for training.
- **Transformer Fine-tuning:** Leveraging a pre-trained DistilBERT model with Hugging Face’s Trainer API.
- **Deployment:** Code for a Flask API for real-time inference.
- **Model Hosting:** Support for pushing the model (in `.safetensors` format) to a private Hugging Face repository, ensuring seamless CPU/GPU usage.

---

## Features

- **Dual Modeling Approaches:** Reinforcement Learning & Transformer-based classification.
- **Custom Gym Environment:** Simulates name validation using RL.
- **Transformer Fine-tuning:** State-of-the-art NLP model for accurate classification.
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrix plots for performance evaluation.
- **Flask API:** A simple REST API for real-time inference.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Push and load models in `.safetensors` format with ease.
- **Crypto Donations:** Support the project with crypto donations!

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/name-validation-ai.git
   cd name-validation-ai
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**

   Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note:** If you're using Google Colab, you can run each provided code block directly.

3. **Dependencies:**

   - `transformers`
   - `datasets`
   - `safetensors`
   - `stable-baselines3`
   - `gym`
   - `flask`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `seaborn`
   - `huggingface_hub`

## Usage

### Training

- **Reinforcement Learning Model:**  
  Use the provided training notebook/code block to set up the custom Gym environment and train a PPO agent for name validation.

- **Transformer-based Model:**  
  Fine-tune a transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) on a balanced dataset of real and fake names. The final model is saved in `.safetensors` format for robust, secure, and efficient storage.

### Testing

- **Confusion Matrix:**  
  Run the testing code block to evaluate the transformer-based model. The block collects predictions on a test set, computes a confusion matrix, and visualizes the results using Seaborn.

- **Flask API:**  
  Deploy a Flask API to accept a first name as input and return a prediction (real or fake) in real time.

### Push to Hugging Face

The project includes code to push the trained model (saved in `.safetensors` format) to a private Hugging Face repository using the HTTP-based methods. This ensures that the model can be easily loaded on CPU (or GPU) for inference.
